Postdoctoral fellow, [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr/public/)\
Toulouse, France


## Bio
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [Computer Science Lab, University of Avignon](https://lia.univ-avignon.fr/) (CERI-LIA) and [Laboratory for Analysis and Architecture of Systems](https://www.laas.fr/public/) - [French National Centre for Scientific Research](https://www.cnrs.fr/en) (LAAS-CNRS), Toulouse, France. I received a Ph.D from [CentraleSupélec - Paris-Saclay University](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/). My thesis has also been conducted at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/), France. My research interests include network modelling, network optimization, resource allocation and orchestration in communication networks.
